# Description
This is a template for a laser-cut business card with holes for hex bolts and ticks measuring (both Imperial and metric).

# Instructions
1. Download the bCard.svg
1. Add text with your name and information to the file
1. Cut on a laser cutter from your material of choice. I used 1/16" clear acrylic.

# Notes
The holes in the card are meant to be used on bolts, but I don't recommend applying too much torque with them.
